# Pirate-Text-Adventure
I made this C++ adventure as part of the Codecademy curriculum. All of this is my own code, written by me on a long summer day.

V1 has four endings. The game is simple, using 2-3 choices to control the flow. Have fun!
V2 may include while loops to fix the "Invalid" to save code.
